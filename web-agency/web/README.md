## Introduction

A top menu bar for web and mobile devices. In this template, I learned about making a custom React component to be used on different pages.

The "Header Component" can be used in all the pages of the application. Loading, reloading or resizing the page the responsive top menu bar is shown.

Everything is made using:

- Nodejs
- React with TypeScript
- Styled-Components

  - I still want to do:
    1. A custom Sign in component;
    2. A custom Register component;
    3.  Show the pages for authenticated users;
    4. A mobile version using React Native.
